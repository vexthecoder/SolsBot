## FAQ
(1) I have finished setting up the discord bot but the slash commands wont show up!<br>
--> Discord takes a while to sync up the commands, so the best bet you have is to keep refreshing your discord app or just wait a while.

(2) I set a User ID but it still says I don't have permission to use the commands!<br>
--> Make sure you have set the User ID to YOUR User ID and NOT the bot's User ID. Close and reopen the application to apply the changes.

(3) Do I have to have a webhook setup to use the Discord Bot features?<br>
--> At the current moment, yes, but I will be changing that later down the line so you wont have to set that up.

(?) Soon...
